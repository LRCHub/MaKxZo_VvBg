Sometimes I’m Virginia Wolfe,
Sometimes I’m James Dean
Sometimes I’m my only friend and my own worst enemy
My right hand never knows what my left one’s gonna do
But I never meant to cause the harm that I have done to you
Sometimes I drink Beaujolais
Sometimes I drink gin
Sometimes the whiskey does me right
And sometimes it does me in
But you’ve seen all my darker shades and everything I’ve been
Still I can hurt myself much more than anyone else can
I’m worried for no reason, I’m worried and I’m blue
But there’s no better cure for it than being next to you
I can’t hide what I am, I guess it’s plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes I live in a penthouse
Sometimes I live in a shack
Sometimes I fall off the wagon like a train running off the track
But I reckon that I’ll jump back on it, get this monkey off my back
Before I wind up back in prison or give myself another heart attack
I’m worried for no reason, I’m worried and I’m blue
But there’s no better cure for it than being next to you
I can’t hide what I am, I guess it’s plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
