Repeat and rewind
I'm not going there this time
If I could make a plan
I wouldn't go there again
Hold it up, let it out
Life won't ever stop it's time
Give it up, fight it out
Leave the white flag behind
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Pain, pleasure)
Don't stop now with the pressure
(Pleasure, pain)
Can't explain with an answer
(Pain, pleasure)
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Pleasure, pain)
Catch me if you can
Chase me if you'd like
I don't know about you
But I'm a do or die
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Pain, pleasure)
(Pleasure, pain)
Can't explain with an answer
(Ride the pain into the pleasure)
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Ride the pain)
Into the pleasure, you'll find your answer
Into the pleasure, you'll find your answer
Into the pleasure, you'll find your answer
Into the pleasure
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
I haven't seen or heard enough
'Til I've looked under every rock
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Pain, pleasure)
Don't stop now with the pressure
(Pleasure, pain)
Can't explain with an answer
(Pain, pleasure)
Ride the pain into the pleasure
(Ride the pain into the pleasure)
Can't explain with an answer
(Ride the pain into the pleasure)
Can't explain with an answer
(Into the pleasure)
