I fall off of that wagon
Won't be no last call
Don't believe I'm bragging
But I feel no pain at all
No pain at all

Always been scared of flying
The writings on the wall
Don't let me catch you crying
'Cause I feel no pain at all
No pain at all
No pain at all

You hear those angels singing
In that soulful southern drawl
When you hear the church bells ringing
And I feel no pain at all
No pain at all
No pain at all

No pain at all
